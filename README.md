# Project Title: AnthroLink
### Learn It Girl’19

#### Abstract
Through this program, I plan to develop a web application to connect citizens to their nearest NGOs and/or regional recycling plants. A lot of plastic waste is generated at a household level which should not be sent out to the landfills but to recycling plants. The main features of my application are listed below:

1. This app will connect users to their regional recycling plants, and help them set up a pickup so they can dispose of their plastic waste responsibly. 

2. It will also connect users to their nearest NGOs or such organisations, where they would be able to donate secondary resources like used clothes, remaining food, etc, which would further be distributed to the needy. 

3. The app will also sync with the users’ Google calendar and give them reminders about upcoming pickups. 

4. The app can further be improved to set up a pickup for a whole society/RWA in addition to just a single citizen.
